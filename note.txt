PATREON
	Hello everyone! We are the MADiSON development team.
We have been working full time in the game for several months, driven by our passion for videogames and horror.
Our devotion for game dev and all the hard work and hours invested (friends' and family's too), led us to create a demo we are proud of unveiling to all of you.
The demo is an experience of a few minutes where we show the mechanics and the potential of the game. For us, letting you play with what we have come up is key to building trust between you and us.
The plans are to finish the game by mid-2018 and publish it on steam. We still have months of development ahead but we are confident that everything will be more than fine.
Our main goal today is to be able to deliver a full game experience. We'd love to have your support in this awesome journey.
With the help of each one of you, we seek to improve the character modeling, voice acting, to pay software licenses, localisations, sound fx and also collaborate with us and our small studio to continue working more effectively.

ABOUT US

Alexis Di Stefano: I have been passionate about horror genre since I was a child, a huge horror videogames and films lover. I am the creator, writer and director of the game and the guy in charge of the game design and all the visuals of the game. 
This project started off as an assignment while studying video game design. After I graduated last year I understood that MADiSON needed to become real, so I have worked tirelessly on developing the game since then.

KICKSTARTER

I know there are a hundred thousand independent game developers floating around on the internet, and I'm not going to pretend that I'm radically different from any one of them. I will say that in a sea of wonderful creativity there's still something left to be desired. I miss the 80's and 90's. My games have always been heavily inspired by gaming of the NES and SNES era. If you're looking for modern, artsy fartsy games with lengthy tutorials, I'm probably not going to be making something you're interested in. If you're looking for an oldschool gaming itch to get scratched, I might be able to help!

Everything I've designed tends to hark back to games I've enjoyed growing up in the late 80's and early 90's. Blaster Master, Metroid, Air Fortress, Journey to Silius, and a lot of other classics are all major inspirations for me. Making sure everything I create pays homage to those in some way is very important.

I've participated in a few themed game jams/game showcases, and below are some games to check out~
