Log: ICS V8.44

OverbyteIcsWSocket.pas

ReverseDnsLookup supports wsoIcsDnsLookup to use thread.

SslSetCertX509 did not load Inter unless Cert set.  This change means SSL clients can share a root CA between multiple components by loading it to one with Context.SslCertX509.LoadIntersFromPemFile or Context SslCertX509.LoadIntersFromString and then copying it to new clients by NewContext.SslCertX509.X509Inters := Context.SslCertX509.X509Inters. Also to other SSL servers as NewContext.SslCertX509.X509CATrust := Context.SslCertX509.X509Inters for validation.

ICS V8.43

OverbyteIcsWSocket.pas

Added new ComponentOptions wsoAsyncDnsLookup and wsoIcsDnsLookup, thanks to ant_s@rambler.ru.
Setting wsoAsyncDnsLookup causes Connect to use async DNS lookups instead of blocking sync without needing to call DnsLookUp first and then Connect.
Setting wsoIcsDnsLookup causes DnsLookUp to use a thread for async DNS lookups for IPv4 (previously only IPv6) to avoid a windows limitation of one active DNS lookup per thread.  Defaults to one thread per CPU with a queue of lookup requests.

V8.41

New TSslCertTools component to create and sign certificates is finished.
More minor SSL improvements for certificates.

The HTTP client and server samples will be updated shortly to demo the new certificate features, which I've been testing in my own applications. 

This completes the batch of major SSL improvements over the past four months, so now just bug fixing as the new features get incorporated into applications and more widely used. There is still a planned new SSL file and string digest signing component planned.   

OverbyteIcsWSocket.pas
Fix bug in last build with TX509Base PEM cert error handling.

Simplified checks for base64 certificates.

Binary format certificate files are now saved correctly.

Implemented intermediate certificate support in TX509Base which includes loading and saving them from file formats supporting them, and LoadIntersFromPemFile, LoadIntersFromString, SaveIntersToToPemFile, GetIntersList and ListInters.

Implemented CA certificate support in TX509Base mainly for chain verification, LoadCAFromPemFile, LoadCAFromString.

KeyInfo displays correct key length and curve for certificates.

CertInfo has Brief option for shorter description.

ValidateCertChain in TX509Base checks and reports cert and inters and can save a lot of cert problems in servers.

Added AllCertInfo to TX509List that reports all certificates and can save code in clients reporting certificates.

Added sslCiphersMozillaSrvInterFS with only forward security ciphers.

Added IsCertLoaded, IsPkeyLoaded and IsInterLoaded to TX509Base.

Added SslKeyAuth property to get cipher key authentication.

Added SslGetCerts to context to get cert, key and intermediates.

Added SslSetCertX509 to context which sets cert, key and intermediates from FSslCertX509 to load all together. If FSslCertX509 in Context has cert loaded when context is initialised, context file properties are ignored and SslSetCertX509 called to load them.

Made InitializeSsl public in TSslBaseComponent for more control over SSL loading and unloading.


OverbyteIcsLIBEAY.pas
OverbyteIcsSSLEAY.pas

Added more NIDs, constants and a few more imported functions.


OverbyteIcsSslX509Utils.pas

Added CreateCertBundle to build a new PEM or PKCS12 file combining certificate, private key and intermediate files.

Added more certificate request extension properties including alt domains.

Creating requests now adds alternate domains, IP addresses, etc.

Create certificate from request now optionally copies extensions.

The old CreateCertRequest and CreateSelfSignedCert functions now use the TSslCertTools component and provide backward compatibility.


Create Certificate Bundle
-------------------------
Builds a new PEM or PKCS12 file by combining certificate, private key and
intermediate files (in any formats with correct file extension).  For servers,
a bundle file is easier to distribute and load than three separate files.
1 - CreateCertBundle is a simple function, that requires four full file names
for the three input files and output file, optional load and save passwords,
and the cipher optionally to encrypt the output file.

Jan 29, 2017  V8.40

New TSslCertTools component to create and sign certificates.
More minor SSL improvements.
Major update of OverbyteIcsPemtool sample.

The main SSL changes have been running on my public server since December, but the new TSslCertTools component still needs more testing and is missing some minor functionality, any comments appreciated.  

The two main functional changes are that ICS now supports all the common SSL certificate file formats (previously just PEM) so it should no longer be necessary to mess around with the OpenSSL tools converting file formats, and now support Elliptic Curve (ECDSA) private keys and certificates, which have lower overhead than RSA keys and certificates.  

There is also a major change to SSL debug logging.  Previously loSslInfo created vast log files with lots of BIO lines which were not related to the SSL protocol but which are really for internal ICS development. These BIO lines have now gone, and been replaced by some more useful debugging lines and full hex dumps of all SSL protocol packets.  If decoded, these dumps can be used to locate SSL protocol issues when negotiation fails, which can currently be done using Wireshark externally. Unfortunately decoding these protocol packets is not trivial, there is a new event OnSslProtoMsg which receives the raw data if someone has the time to look further at this.    

OverbyteIcsWSocket.pas
Jan 27, 2017  V8.40 
TX509Base can now read and save all common X509 certificate file formats:
  .PEM, .CER, .CRT - Base64 encoded DER - LoadFromPemFile/SaveToPemFile
  .DER, .CER, .CRT - binary DER - LoadFromPEMFile/SaveToDERFile
  .P7B, .P7R, .SPC - PKCS#7 - LoadFromP7BFile/SaveToP7BFile
  .PFX, .P12 - PKCS#12 - LoadFromP12File/SaveToP12File
   PEM/P12 may have certificate and private key
   PEM/P7B/P12 may have extra intermediate certificates

LoadFromFile/SaveToFile uses file extension to choose file format.

Extra options for TX509Base methods to load and save files to specify if private key should be read or saved and the password.

TX509Base will now encrypt private keys with a password. 

CheckCertAndPKey in TX509Base checks cert and pkey match. 

SslCertX509 in context now public not published, returns certificate and private key from the context rather than what was loaded, and may be used to set both, overriding any previous settings.

Fixed bug in TX509Base.SerialNumHex to show correct serial, note most browsers display serial in hex not a numeric value.

Added SerialNumHexto GetCertInfo.

Fixed bug in TX509Base.SerialNum to clear SSL error for an illegal serial, to avoid handshaking later failing with 'asn1_get_uint64:too large' (mainly when logging was enabled).

TX509Base.SerialNum now returns an int64 instead of integer, but only correctly with 1.1.0 and later (or use SerialNumHex instead).

Added SslSecLevel to context to set security level (1.1.0 and later), defaults to sslSecLevel80bits, set sslSecLevelNone for SSLv3.

Added CheckPrivateKey to context which checks loaded certificate and private key match.

Added OnSslProtoMsg event which receives SSL protocol messages (in binary, need decoding) for debugging purposes.

Added loSslDevel to ICS logger which replaces many loSslInfo logging lines for BIO. read and write which are really internal ICS development use to make logging more readable, added more useful loSslInfo lines.

Added SslBuildCertChain to context for servers to validate correct certificates loaded OK  (not sure how useful yet).

Added SslGetCertChain to context for servers to get list of certificates in chain (not sure how useful yet).

Added ReadOnly option to IcsSslOpenFileBio since mostly we don't want to update certificates.

GetKeyInfo now support both RSA and EC keys, displays curve names. Added GetPKeyRawText to display private key raw values.

Added PrivateKeyInfo to display private key type and size.

Added CertPolicies, AuthorityKeyId, SubjectKeyId and CRLDistribution extended certificate properties.

Added ExtendedValidation returns true for EV certificates.

OpenSSL 1.1.0 and later support security levels, as follows:
    TSslSecLevel = (
         sslSecLevelAny,        // 0 - anything allowed, old compatibility
         sslSecLevel80bits,     // 1 - default, RSA/DH keys=>1024, ECC=>160, no MD5
         sslSecLevel112bits,    // 2 - RSA/DH keys=>2048, ECC=>224, no RC4, no SSL3, no SHA1 certs
         sslSecLevel128bits,    // 3 - RSA/DH keys=>3072, ECC=>256, FS forced, no TLS/1.0
         sslSecLevel192bits,    // 4 - RSA/DH keys=>7680, ECC=>384, no SHA1 suites, no TLS/1.1
         sslSecLevel256bits);   // 5 - RSA/DH keys=>15360, ECC=>512

Create string and file encryption component from existing functions


Using TSslCertTools component
=============================

The main test application for the component is the OverbyteIcsPemtool sample,
which illustrates use of all the methods and properties.

Message digests or hashes:
    TEvpDigest = (Digest_md5, Digest_mdc2, Digest_sha1, Digest_sha224,
        Digest_sha256, Digest_sha384, Digest_sha512, Digest_ripemd160);

Private key algorithm and key length in bits, bracketed comment is security
level and effective bits, beware long RSA key lengths increase SSL overhead heavily:
    TSslPrivKeyType = (
        PrivKeyRsa1024,   // level 1 - 80 bits
        PrivKeyRsa2048,   // level 2 - 112 bits
        PrivKeyRsa3072,   // level 3 - 128 bits
        PrivKeyRsa4096,   // level 3 - 148 bits?
        PrivKeyRsa7680,   // level 4 - 192 bits
        PrivKeyRsa15360,  // level 5 - 256 bits
        PrivKeyECsecp256, // level 3 - 128 bits
        PrivKeyECsecp384, // level 4 - 192 bits
        PrivKeyECsecp512, // level 5 - 256 bits
        PrivKeyECX25519); // level 3 - 128 bits

Private key file encryption:
   TSslPrivKeyCipher = (
        PrivKeyEncNone, PrivKeyEncTripleDES, PrivKeyEncIDEA, PrivKeyEncAES128,
        PrivKeyEncAES192, PrivKeyEncAES256, PrivKeyEncBlowfish128);

Create a new private key file
-----------------------------
A private key is required to create a self signed certificate or a certificate
request, and needs to be installed on any SSL servers (never distribute it).
1 - Set property PrivKeyType (RSA or EC) from TSslPrivKeyType.
2 - Create keys using DoKeyPair method checking exception for any errors.
3 - PrivateKey property contains pointer to new private key.
4 - If file to be encrypted, set property PrivKeyCipher from TSslPrivKeyCipher.
5 - Save private key to file using PrivateKeySaveToPemFile method with optional password.
6 - Optionally save public key to file using PublicKeySaveToPemFile method.

Create a new certificate request from properties
------------------------------------------------
A certificate request is needed to buy a commercial SSL certificate from a public
certificate authority and most importantly specifies the host domain name of the
public SSL server it will secure.
1 - Create a new private key (see above) or load an old key using
PrivateKeyLoadFromPemFile or PrivateKeyLoadFromText methods.
2 - Specify request properties, CommonName (host domain name), Country, State,
Locality, Organization, OrgUnit, KeyDigiSign, KeyKeyEnc, etc, as needed.
3 - Create request using DoCertReqProps method checking exception for any errors.
4 - X509Req property contains pointer to new request.
5 - Save request to PEM file using SaveReqToFile method.
6 - Optionally save request to string using SaveReqToText method.

Create a new certificate request from old certificate
-----------------------------------------------------
This is a shorter way to create a new request when renewing an existing
certificate with the same private key.
1 - Load existing certificate using LoadFromFile or LoadFromText methods.
2 - Load private key for existing certificate using PrivateKeyLoadFromPemFile or
PrivateKeyLoadFromText methods.
3 - Create request using DoCertReqOld method checking exception for any errors.
4 - X509Req property contains pointer to new request.
5 - Save request to PEM file using SaveReqToFile method.
6 - Optionally save request to string using SaveReqToText method.

Create new self signed certificate from properties
--------------------------------------------------
Self signed certificates are mostly used for testing SSL applications on
temporary servers, prior to final deployment to a public server with a
commercial SSL certificate.  Can also used for internal networks.   May
also be used to create your own CA certificate if you want to sign your
own certificates.
1 - Create a new private key (see above) or load an old key using
PrivateKeyLoadFromPemFile or PrivateKeyLoadFromText methods.
2 - Specify certificate properties, CommonName (host domain name), Country, State,
Locality, Organization, OrgUnit, KeyDigiSign, KeyKeyEnc, etc, as needed.
3 - Create certificate using DoSelfSignCert method checking exception for any errors.
4 - X509 property contains pointer to new certificate.
5 - If file to be encrypted, set property PrivKeyCipher from TSslPrivKeyCipher.
6 - Save certificate to file using SaveToFile method with the file extension
specifying the format that should be used.  Options include IncludePrivateKey
which will save the private key into the same PEM or P12 file, and optional password.
7 - Optionally save certificate to string using SaveCertToText method.

Create new CA signed certificate from certificate request
---------------------------------------------------------
This is how commercial certificate authorities create SSL certificates from
a request, signing it with their own CA certificate (root or intermediate) that
will be trusted by Windows due to the root already being installed locally.
For development, you can create your own CA root certificate and install it in
the Windows certificate store of any test computers, then create certificates
signed by the root and they will be trusted by Windows without needing to accept
security exceptions as happens with self signed certificates.
1 - The CA certificate and CA private key need to loaded using LoadFromFile and
PrivateKeyLoadFromPemFile into X509 and PrivateKey, and these properties
assigned to X509CA and PrivKeyCA respectively.
2 - Load certificate request using LoadReqFromFile.
3 - Currently the subject certificate properties are taken from the request and
can not be edited, extended properties are currently taken from properties,
KeyDigiSign, KeyKeyEnc, etc, as needed.  This needs more work for flexibility.
4 - Create certificate using DoSignCertReq method checking exception for any errors.
5 - X509 property contains pointer to new certificate.
6 - If file to be encrypted, set property PrivKeyCipher from TSslPrivKeyCipher.
7 - Save certificate to file using SaveToFile method with the file extension
specifying the format that should be used.  Options include IncludePrivateKey
which will save the private key into the same PEM or P12 file, and optional password.
8 - Optionally save certificate to string using SaveCertToText method.
Beware the private key used to create the request must be loaded into PrivateKey
property before saving a private key with the certificate, otherwise the CA key
may be incorrectly saved.
Pending - save details of certificates created to database, to support
transparency and certificate revocation lists.  Currently certificates have
random serial numbers, should allow sequential numbers to be allocated.

Convert certificate from one file format to another
---------------------------------------------------
1 - Load existing certificate using LoadFromFile or LoadFromText methods.
2 - Optionally load private key for existing certificate using
PrivateKeyLoadFromPemFile or PrivateKeyLoadFromText methods.
4 - If file to be encrypted, set property PrivKeyCipher from TSslPrivKeyCipher.
4 - Save certificate to file using SaveToFile method with the file extension
specifying the format that should be used.  Options include IncludePrivateKey
which will save the private key into the same PEM or P12 file, and optional password.
One use for this is to convert base64 DER/PEM certificates into P12/PVX format
that can be easily installed into the Windows certificate store.

Create New DHParams File
------------------------
DHParams contain prime numbers needed to support DH and DHE ciphers (but not
ECDH and ECDHE).  Ideally they should be unique per server and/or application
and some applications even generate new params each day.  But finding prime
numbers is time consuming, the shortest 1,024 bits can take up a minute, 2,048
bits several minutes, 4,096 bits a few hours, and gave up with 8,192 bits after
two days.  ICS include constants sslDHParams2048 and sslDHParams4096 to save
you calculating your own.
1 - Assign OnKeyProgress event handler with Application.ProcessMessages and
optionally a progress indicator so the application remains responsive while
calculating DHParams.
2 - Create DHParams using DoDHParams method passing new file name and number of
bits, 768, 1024, 20248, 4096, 8192.
3 - Optionally save DHParams string returned by DoDHParams method.

Display multiple certificate file formats.

Using new TSslCertTools component to read, create and save certificates, private keys, certificate requests, DHParams, and to sign requests as a certificate authority.

This tool can now be used to convert different format certificate files between formats, by reading one format and saving as
a different format.  Also combining keys and certificates in a file.

Nov 23, 2016  V8.39 

Yet more SSL improvements.  

The main change is to support host name verification using OpenSSL APIs added since the original ICS SSL implementation was done, so it's no longer necessary to use PostConnectionCheck in the handshake event.  The native verification has improved flexibility for checking partial and wild card domain names, and may be controlled by a new SslCheckHostFlags in the context. The new host name check is enabled by default, but there is no harm in PostConnectionCheck doing a second check so it's backward compatible, but may be disabled by setting sslX509_NO_HOST_CHECK.  The host name checked is SslServerName which is set by the main high level components.  

There are also new functions to ease checking and listing SSL certificates loaded into a context, or contained in a CA bundle file, which are primarily for diagnostic and development purposes, since working out precisely what is contained in base64 encoded certificate files can be challenging.    

OverbyteIcsWSocket.pas
OverbyteIcsLIBEAY.pas
OverbyteIcsSSLEAY.pas
OverbyteIcsSslX509Utils.pas

Minimum OpenSSL support is now 1.0.2 (1.0.1 support ceases Dec 2016).

Added functions to check certificate params using X509_VERIFY_PARAM, which means the peer certificate common name is now checked against the host set as SslServerName during handshaking instead of needing to use PostConnectionCheck in the handshake event.

Added more SslVerifyFlags for extra certificate verification options.

Added SslCheckHostFlags to context to control host name checking.

Added SslCertPeerName property set after successful SSL handshake and peer certificate check that returns matched name from certificate.

Combined TX509Ex properties into TX509Base from OverbyteIcsSslX509Utils to simplify applications. 

TX509Base has new methods CheckHost, CheckEmail and CheckIPaddr as alternatives to PostConnectionCheck using OpenSSL APIs.

Added SslGetAllCerts to context to get TX509list of certificates from context store, may be used to check CA certificates have been correctly loaded from files, 1.1.0 and later.

TX509List has new LoadFromFile method to load all certificates from a bundle file.

Added IcsSslOpenFileBio and IcsSslLoadStackFromInfoFile which were previously methods in TSslContext so thjey can be used elsewhere.

Added IcsUnwrapNames which changes multi-line string to comma string.

Added SslCertX509 to context which returns last certificate loaded for reporting purposes (can not be set yet).

Nov 15, 2016  V8.38 

These changes are to support checking of the authenticode code signing digital certificates on the latest versions of the ICS built OpenSSL DLLs.  
The new IcsVerifyTrust can also be used to self test digitally signed end user applications to check they are not corrupted or maliciously altered. 

To ensure only the latest signed OpenSSL DLLs are used from the local directory, all applications should add the following lines in FormCreate or at least before any calls that may cause OpenSSL to be initialised:

GSSLEAY_DLL_IgnoreNew := False;  { V8.38 don't ignore OpenSSL 1.1.0 and later }
GSSLEAY_DLL_IgnoreOld := True;   { V8.38 ignore OpenSSL 1.0.2 and earlier }
GSSL_DLL_DIR := ExtractFilePath(ParamStr(0)); { V8.38 only from our directory }
GSSL_SignTest_Check := True;     { V8.38 check digitally signed }
GSSL_SignTest_Certificate := True; { V8.38 check digital certificate }

Without these lines, your application may load old OpenSSL versions found in the Windows path, with unpredictable results. 


OverbyteIcsUtils.pas
Added IcsVerifyTrust to check authenticode code signing digital certificate and hash on EXE and DLL files, note currently ignores certificate revoke checking since so slow.

Continuing the clean up of old stuff gone from OpenSSL 1.1.0. 
Now using new names for imports renamed in OpenSSL 1.1.0. 

This is a further interim build with no functional SSL changes, further changes are
planned next week.

OverbyteIcsWSocket.pas
Added ExclusiveAddr property to stop other applications listening on same socket.
Added extended exception information, set FSocketErrs = wsErrFriendly for some more friendly messages (without error numbers).
ESocketException has several more properties to detail errors.

Note the improved exceptions are a work in progress, further friendly messages need to be added, and the new properties extended to other components. 
The intention is only to improve errors commonly presented to end users, currently Listen Bind which now says which address:port conflicts. Further suggestions welcomed. 

OverbyteIcsWSocketS.pas
TWSocketMultiListenItem now has SslEnable moved from SSL class.
Added extended exception information.

Major rewrite to simplify loading OpenSSL DLL functions, using tables driven imports, which are much easier to maintain and appear to save about 35Kbytes of program space.  

Reversed V8.34 fix so this release only supports 1.1.0 not 1.1.1.  The latter may have changed imports. 
OPENSSL_ALLOW_SSLV2 gone with all SSLv2 functions.
Stub more removed functions to save some exceptions.
Moved all imports from OverbyteIcsLibeayEx to OverbyteIcsLibeay to make maintenance and use easier, OverbyteIcsLibeayEx may be removed.
EVP_CIPHER_CTX_xx is now backward compatible with 1.1.0.

Sept 5, 2016  V8.34 Angus

Correct next OpenSSL release is 1.1.1 not 1.1.0a, so this build will support up to 1.1.999.
 
Added public variable GSSLEAY_DLL_IgnoreOld so only OpenSSL 1.1.0 and later are loaded. 

Will need to revisit this stuff when OpenSSL 1.2.0 is released with new DLL names in a few years time, maybe sooner if it's needed for TLS/1.3, although 1.1.0 already contains many of the new features.

Updated SSL support for the final OpenSSL 1.1.0 release.  

Beware four new DLL names, libssl-1_1.dll, libssl-1_1-x64.dll, libcrypto-1_1.dll and libcrypto-1_1-x64.dll 

Please see notes from the V8.27 and V8.29 for details of the many changes involved.  

Essentially, ICS currently supports OpenSSL 1.0.1, 1.0.2 and 1.1.0, looking for the latter DLLs first unless GSSLEAY_DLL_IgnoreNew is set true when 1.1.0 will be ignored.  There are new methods for use with 1.1.0, but these have been made backward compatible so will work with 1.0.x as well as possible. 

Moved sslRootCACertsBundle constant to OverbyteIcsSslX509Utils and split smaller and made function so it will compile under C++ Builder.

The timeout issue may have effected ICS web server large uploads that took longer than the timeout, but not the FTP server which uses a different timeout method.

A Chinese hacker port scanning managed to crash the ICS web server on all three of my public servers (automatic restart fortunately) with very short connections resulting in WSAESHUTDOWN exceptions.  Only seen this once before in millions of requests, but now fixed to cleanly close connection.

ICS V8.27 
These changes all relate to SSL support, in summary:
1 - Support for OpenSSL 1.1.0 (due real soon, currently beta).  Beware new DDL names.
2 - Allow TLS version be specified as a range of versions instead of a single version.
3 - Allow SSL certificates, private keys, CA bundles and DHParams to be loaded from strings instead of files, so they can be saved or created in the application without using any files. 
4 - Allow OpenSSL DLLs to be loaded from a specific directory.
5 - Report ciphers available from OpenSSL, including those for specific sessions (1.1.0 only)
6 - Include DHParams and Root CA Certs Bundle as constant strings to avoid files.  

Note that applications using public SSL variables GSSLEAY_xxx will need to add OverbyteIcsSSLEAY to Uses since they have been consolidated in a single unit.  Otherwise applications using OpenSSL 1.0.1, 1.0.2 or 1.1.0 should behave unchanged.  

Please treat ICS V8.27 as a beta version due to the number of changes, test applications heavily and watch for any fixes needed. 


Source/OverbyteIcsWSocket.pas

V8.27 Angus, initial support for OpenSSL 1.1.0, new DLL file names, old exports gone.

Add public variable GSSLEAY_DLL_IgnoreNew which should be set to TRUE before calling any SSL functions if OpenSSL 1.1.0 should be ignored.  Otherwise libcrypto-1_1.dll found in the PATH will override libeay32.dll in the local directory.

Added public variable GSSL_BUFFER_SIZE defaults to 16384, previously fixed at 4096, may improve SSL performance if larger.

Added public variable GSSL_DLL_DIR if set before OpenSSL loaded, will use this directory for DLLs, must have trailing \.

SslContext adds SslMinVersion and SslMaxVersion properties to  specify the minimum and maximum SSL/TLS versions supported from: sslVerSSL3,sslVerTLS1,sslVerTLS1_1,sslVerTLS1_2,sslVerTLS1_3,sslVerMax, note 1.3 is not yet supported.  Although introduced for 1.1.0, these properties have also been implemented for 1.0.1/1.0.2 by  internally using Options.  SslVersionMethod is ignored for 1.1.0  and SslMinVersion > sslVerSSL3 or SslMaxVersion < sslVerMax.

SslContext now allows SSL certificates, private keys, CA bundles and DHParams to be loaded from strings instead of files, allowing them to be saved or created in the application without using any files.  New properties SslCertLines, SslPrivKeyLines, SslCALines and SslDHParamLines allow PEM formatted certificates and keys to be saved with the form or loaded as TStrings.  SslCertLines may be a single certificate or a bundle including one or more intermediates, but must not include the private key.  There are new public methods LoadCertFromString, LoadPKeyFromString, LoadCAFromString and LoadDHParamsFromString that can be used to update the certificates after SslContext is initialised.

SslContext has a new method SslGetAllCiphers that returns a multi line list of the ciphers supported by OpenSSL although some may be unusable if the correct protocols,  EC and DHParams are not set.

TSslWSocket has a new method SslGetSupportedCiphers (Supported, Remote) that returns a multi line list of ciphers. Supported=True is only for 1.1.0 and later and returns the actual ciphers available for the session allowed by the protocols, EC and DHParams.  Remote=True for list received by server from remote client, Remote=False is list supported by client or server. Supported=False is list of all ciphers.

Added sslDHParams2048 and sslDHParams4096 constants, the latter is used as SslDHParamLines default so applications support DH and ECDH ciphers without needed a DHParams file.  Still better to generate your own DHParams and load them.

Added sslRootCACertsBundle constant as a Root CA Certs Bundle of about 30 PEM certificates extracted from Windows 2012 R2 server by OverbyteIcsPemtool, assign this to SslContext.SslCALines.Text to verify remote SSL certificates in client applications, not for servers. This is not used as a default to avoid linking the list unless needed.

Many SslOptions are no longer supported for 1.1.0 and are now ignored.   

Cleaned up SSL initialisation.

SSL debug logging has been improved by logging SSL certificate subjects when loaded from lines, and logging ciphers when SslContext is initialised.

SslECDHMethod is ignored for 1.1.0, always enabled.    

Various internal SSL changes to accommodate new or removed functions with 1.1.0.

X509Base has new methods LoadFromText and PrivateKeyLoadFromText that load a PEM SSL certificate and private key from strings. A certificate may already be saved to a string by GetRawText.

This block of changes is SSL improvements, in particular adding the ability for ICS SSL web server and client samples to be used to test specific SSL protocols and ciphers for compatibility.  The SSL web server can be forced to use SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2 to see if clients will connect, and SSL ciphers selected from the different options available in ICS.  The Browser sample may similarly be forced to use specific SSL protocols to test against other SSL web servers.  

OverbyteIcsWSocket.pas
V8.25 Updated sslCiphersMozillaSrvxxx cipher literals to latest versions, but left old versions with suffix 38 for backward compatibility.

Added local IP address selection instead of all addresses. SSL Version and SSL Cipher may be selected from lists or specific ciphers specified to make testing easier.  Reset SSL when changing parameters to try and force new negotiation, but may need to restart application to be sure. Report server SSL certificates and warn if expired.  Display more SSL diagnostics on the demo.html menu so clients can see the SSL capabilities.

BrowserDemo sample
Updated to work with HtmlViewer 11.6 from https://github.com/BerndGabriel/HtmlViewer which has changed InsertImage, ImageObject and onGetPostRequestEx. Improved SSL handshake reporting, Settings now allows specific SSL protocols to be forced for testing. Settings has options to display SSL certificates.

This block of changes relate to improved checking and reporting of SSL certificates, specifically being able to find the certificate and key encryption algorithms, which is increasingly important since SHA1 signed certificates are being phased out, as are keys shorter than 2048 bits.   

TX509Ex includes a new function CertInfo that returns a multiline string of certificate information for logging, similarly to the following:   

Issued to: Google Internet Authority G2, Google Inc
Issuer: GeoTrust Global CA, GeoTrust Inc.
Expires: 31/12/2016, Signature: sha256WithRSAEncryption
Public Key: rsaEncryption 2048 bits

OverbyteIcsWSocket.pas - Jun 05, 2015 V8.18 Angus

Enabled SSL engine support, which are cryptographic modules adding extra algorithms.

All ICS packages are now include OverbyteIcsMsSslUtils and OverbyteIcsSslX509Utils (and some other dependent units) which include SSL certificate display and validation functions, and which were previously only in the SSL samples directory which made them hard to use in other projects and packages. 

Added Samples/Delphi/AllDemosProject.bpg which includes all 95 sample projects, making it easier to build them all together, assuming the version of Delphi does not run out of memory first.

This group of changes allow ICS SSL servers to support DH (Diiffie-Hellman) and EDH/DHE (Ephemeral DH) key exchange, and EC (Elliptic Curve) encryption) for ECDH and EECDH key exchange, as well as the older RSA key exchange.  Note SSL clients already supported these key exchanges. 

DH support requires supply of DH Parameters which are used to generate new keys for each session, which implements Forward Secrecy preventing decryption of old sessions if the certificate key is later broken or stolen.  Currently, ICS only supports reading DH Parameters from a file generated using the opensll.exe utility with key lengths of 512, 1024, 2048, 4096 bits and it's recommended these are generated when an application is installed, although three prepared files are supplied. Beware generating DH Parameters takes a while, about 15 minutes for the 2048 bit file, 30 seconds for the 1024 file.  ICS does not yet have a function to generate DH Parameters but I'll add it shortly, also a way to build them into the application rather than using a file.

EC support is much easier, just selection of SslECDHMethod as sslECDHNone, sslECDHAuto, sslECDH_P256, 
sslECDH_P384 and sslECDH_P521.  Currently MSIE 11 does not seem to like the ICS EC support, still investigating. 

Note that server use of these new options needs matching Ciphers to be available, and all testing has been with sslCiphersMozillaSrvInter.

Mar 16, 2015 V8.15 
Angus added more SslOptions: sslOpt_NO_COMPRESSION, sslOpt_TLSEXT_PADDING, sslOpt_SAFARI_ECDHE_ECDSA_BUG, sslOpt_CISCO_ANYCONNECT, sslOpt_NO_TLSv1_1 and sslOpt_NO_TLSv1_2
Added more SslVersionMethods: sslTLS_V1_1, sslTLS_V1_2 and sslBestVer which is eqivalent to sslV23 and actually means any of SSLV3, TLS1, TLS1.1 or TLS1.2. To disable some versions, use sslBestVer and disable specific ones using SslOptions. To force only one version, set SslVersionMethod to that version. Choosing a specific TLS version will fail if matching Ciphers are not available
OPENSSL_NO_TLSEXT removed so SSL Server Name Identification is always supported
Added SslDHParamFile to load a DH Parameters for Diiffie-Hellman DH and EDH key ciphers. DH param files may have key lengths of 512,1024,2048,4096 bits and currently need to be generated using the opensll.exe utility (or use those that come with ICS)
Added SslECDHMethod to select Elliptic Curves to support ECDH and EECDH key ciphers
Note, only OpenSSL 1.0.1 and later are now supported since this added TLS 1.1/1.2

OverbyteIcsFtpCli.pas

Jul 25, 2013 V7.30 - Angus 
Fixed bug in WaitUntilReady that meant some sync methods with multiple commands randomly terminated prematurely allowing further commands to be sent usually resulting in not ready errors. This showed up in failed resumed uploads, but could have been the reason by other unexplained not ready errors.

TSmtpCli - CLEM added new event to attach stream directly. If assigned OnFileOpen it will make a call that can return a stream instead of opening the file, so you could return a memory stream for example. If the call returns a nil stream it tries to open the file the 'usual' way.

C++ Builder - Made some redundant type declarations of RawByteString and UnicodeString EXTERNALSYMs.
In V8 we should move declarations of both to OverbyteIcsTypes and remove all redundant declarations.

Browser demo removed unnecessary timer to insert downloaded images.

Now using a download image queue and a fixed number of static image download sessions (MaxImageSess=4) rather than downloading potentially dozens of images simultaneously in separate sessions. This allows http/1.1 and keep-alive to work.  

Likewise, Connection used for html and css pages is no longer always closed.

Angus added new demo application FrameBrowserIcs which is an example internet browser using the HtmlViewer component from https://github.com/BerndGabriel/HtmlViewer, http://code.google.com/p/thtmlviewer/ or http://wiki.overbyte.be/wiki/index.php/ICS_Download, which must also be downloaded and installed before the demo can be built.   The demo is based on FrameBrowserIndy project but with various enhancements, specifically display of all HTTP and some HTML traffic which makes it very useful for debugging the THttpCli component. The demo needs SVN Rev #934 or later with the new cookies unit.  An EXE of this demo is also on the wiki download page.

Client Cookie Handling, see RFC2109/RFC6265 (RFC2965 is obsolete)

Provides a memory store for persistent and non-persisent cookies captured from the HTTP SetCookie header, and builds a Cookie header for any stored cookies for a URL.  Persistent cookies are saved and re-read from a simple CSV file.  OverbyteIcsHttpTst1.pas shows how to handle cookies, very few new lines.

Removed calls to System.Randomize and replaced calls to System.Random() by OverbyteIcsUtils.IcsRandomInt().
So we do no longer screw up RTL's global var RandSeed and also use a better XorShift RNG by George Marsagli. See new demo OverbyteIcsPrngTst in MiscDemos which shows the difference (horizontal scratch lines in the bitmap filled with System.Random).

THttpConnection

Feb 07, 2012 V7.44 Arno - The HEAD method *MUST NOT* return a message-body in
                   the response. Do not skip compression on HEAD requests, we
                   need to send the correct size. Method SendDocument
                   simplified and added two overloads. AnswerStreamAcceptRange
                   got an overload too.
Feb 08, 2012 V7.45 Arno - If we receive an unknown method/request we have to
                   close the connection, otherwise we may receive junk data we
                   cannot handle properly.

FSysLogServer component is created runtime on form creation, but 
SysLogServer1DataAvailable method is not assigned to 
FSysLogServer.OnDataAvailable anywhere.

TSysLogServer.ParseRawMessageRFC5424:
 From line 400 to 457 Date and Time values are read from message 
respectively to SYear, SMonth,SDay,SHour,SMinute,SSecond and SMSec
but if there is a Time Bias, SHour,SMinute are owerritten is case 
construct (Line 463,471)
After case construct in line 493,494 DecodedMessage.Hour and 
DecodedMessage.Minute will get values from the overwritten variables.

If client hostname contains negative sign "-" , for example 
"somename-peter", than between lines 520-532 it is evaluated as "invalid 
PID delimter" and an exception is raised.
I dont know if this is a valid hostname for that RFC

Delphi demos are no longer shipped with project and project group files for D2006 and better. Provided each project has at least a .dpr, a stripped down .dof and a resource file all IDE versions convert those projects and old .bpg project groups fine. *Clean.bat has been changed to also delete converted Delphi 2006+ project and project group files*.

OverbyteIcsWsocket 
- Added Sha1Hex, Sha1Digest, IssuedBy, IssuerOf and SelfSigned to TX509Base.
- Deprecated Sha1Hash since it was buggy storing binary in strings. 
- Return values of Sha1Hex and Sha1Digest are cached.
- Reworked TX509List and added some new methods.

OverbyteIcsLIBEAY 
- Made one hack thread-safe (requires one of the TSslxxxLock objects being active).
- Got rid of another hack with OSSL v1.0.0+.

Two SSL-demos updated accordingly.

New SSL demo. Verify and show an OpenSSL certificate or certificate chain using class TMsCertChainEngine which uses MS crypto API. The advantage is that no trusted PEM CA store is required and CRL and OCSP checks (Vista+) are performed by Windows as well. Also unknown root certificates are downloaded from the MS root certificate server if required. It's not very fast so SSL session caching is used to speed things up.

Made the SSL peer certificate available as property TSslWSocket.SslPeerCert. The SslPeerCert is instantiated lazily once and usable after a SSL handshake including the SSL session was reused from cache until the next SSL connection is initialized. It is usable when SslPeerCert.X508 is non-nil. In previous versions the PeerCert passed to OnSslHandshakeDone could be just a reference to one of the certs in the SslCertChain which was eval.

This enables the component user to include CRLs added thru SslCRLFile and SslCRLPath in the certificate verification process. However enabling CRL-checks needs some additional action in the OnSslVerifyPeer event since OpenSSL will the trigger any error related to CRLs. If there's, for instance, no CRL available or it has expired etc.. You find the possible error codes in OverbyteIcsLibeay.pas search i.e. for X509_V_ERR_UNABLE_TO_GET_CRL.

TCustomHttpTunnelWSocket strongly improved.
- Bugfix: Ensure that internally buffered application data is read by the upper layer by posting a fake FD_READ message if required.
- Better support of HTTP/1.0 proxies.
- Performs an internal reconnect when the connection has to be closed after a 407 status code and the server provides a supported authentication method, as a result htatDetect works with non-persistent connections as well.
- Tested with Squid 2.7.STABLE8 for Windows successfully.
- Tested with CSM proxy 4.2 successfully after adding a workaround (requires at least two header lines being sent).
- ISA Server 2006 tested successfully except with digest auth. I wasn't able to get digest authentication working neither IE nor Firefox got authenticated. Interesting is that ISA uses digest algorithm "MD5-sess" that I enabled in OverbyteIcsDigestAuth.pas now, untested!

Proxy authentication with relocations still did not work properly :( It's not perfect but works better now:
Reset only NTLM AuthState in LocationSessionClosed and do not call SetReady while FLocationFlag is set, also call StartRelocation in GetHeaderLineNext if there's no body and the connection is not expected to close, also the relocation counter was incremented twice per relocation when the connection closed.

Added HTTP V1.1 transparent proxy support including Basic and NTLM authentication implemented as TCustomHttpTunnelWSocket. This feature is still in beta state, mainly because I only tested against WinGate proxy server. My goal was to make it as fast as possible, there are no or just very few protected methods available to override so far. Best performance is achieved with one of the authentication types "htatNone", "htatBasic" or "htatNtlm". With "htatDetect" the last successful authentication type is cached until the proxy server name changes or the TWSocket object is freed.

OverbyteIcsWSocketS
Feb 4,  2011 V7.02 Angus added bandwidth throttling using TCustomThrottledWSocket.
                   Client sockets inherit server settings for BandwidthLimit and
                   BandwidthSampling, but these can be changed ideally in
                   OnClientCreate event, but also in OnClientConnect but note a
                   timer may have been started by then so better to default to
                   BandwidthLimit=0 and set it, than to disable it.

Added thread-safe, overrode methods FreeNotification and RemoveFreeNotification to both TSslContext and TIcsLogger. This does not mean that their component notification system became entirely thread-safe. However as long as instances of both are not freed while another component living in a different thread context holds a reference to them it should be safe to share them across multiple threads.

Improved final exception handling. It's now possible to specify how background exceptions (unhandled exceptions) are treated on a per thread basis. Call setter function SetIcsThreadLocalFinalBgExceptionHandling() to enable one of the following options in current thread context. With "fehAppHandleException" unhandled exceptions are passed to the Application exception handler if available, with "fehShowException" unhandled exceptions are displayed either in the console or through Windows MessageBox API (owner HWND = 0). Both options allow tools like MadExcept to catch and display the exception, with "fehNone" (default) unhandled exceptions are thrown away silently.

For instance, if file size is smaller or equal send buffer size a second call to DataSocketPutDataSent turns on the shutdown timeout (loop) even though data is not yet sent.

This fixes a serious performance leak when just a single TIcsThreadTimer instance was used which was created/freed, enabled/unabled or its interval or event handler were changed frequently. Best performance is achieved by setting this property to TRUE.

Fixed a bug in the experimental throttle and timeout source which made it impossible to use both features at the same time (EListError).
Renamed conditionals EXPERIMENTAL_THROTTLE and EXPERIMENTAL_TIMEOUT to BUILTIN_THROTTLE and BUILTIN_TIMEOUT. It's now possible to either enable them in OverbyteIcsDefs.inc or define them in project options.

New property THtmlSmtpCli.HtmlImageCidSuffix which specifies a custom string to be appended to the default Content-ID "IMAGE<number>". Some webmailer did not like our default CID. Thanks to Fabrice Vend‚ for providing a fix.

              and Space after CRLF by #1. Made two implicit string casts

              Demonstrates how to display ANSI text parts properly.
              You need either Delphi 2009 or the TNT Unicode controls
              (Freeware: http://mh-nexus.de/en/tntunicodecontrols.php) to be
              able to view Unicode correctly. Define USE_TNT to use the TntMemo
              instead of TMemo.
